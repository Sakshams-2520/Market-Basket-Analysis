# Market-Basket-Analysis
Analysis of historical customer data can highlight if a certain combination of products purchased makes an additional purchase more likely. This is called market 
basket analysis (also called as MBA). It is a widely used technique to identify the best possible mix of frequently bought products or services. This is also 
called product association analysis. The set of items a customer buys is referred to as an itemset, and market basket analysis seeks to find relationships 
between purchases. Market Basket Analysis creates If-Then scenario rules, for example, if item A is purchased then item B is likely to be purchased. The rules are 
probabilistic in nature or, in other words, they are derived from the frequencies of co-occurrence in the observations. Market Basket analysis is particularly useful 
for physical retail stores as it can help in planning floor space and product placement amongst many other benefits.
